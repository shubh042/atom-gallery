    descriptions: [
      "Carbon is mainly present in the natural state in two allotropic forms: graphite and diamond. Finally, it can be found in other forms such as: Coal, Oil, Sediment. Carbon dioxide, of formula , is present in the atmosphere in the form of gas and in oceanic and continental waters, in the form of dissolved gas.",

      "Carbon is an element insoluble in water as well as in any organic solvent. When strongly heated, it oxidizes to form carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Linked to hydrogen, carbon is the source of life. This connection appears in every organic living being on the planet.",

      "Carbon in its pure form is not dangerous for humans and its ingestion poses no health problem. Care must also be taken with prolonged ingestion of coal, which can cause lung or heart damage. Very harmful, carbon monoxide, with the formula CO, is a colorless and odorless gas that is very toxic to humans. Indeed, it binds even more easily than oxygen to red blood cells and therefore causes fatal asphyxiation."

    name: "Hydrogen",
    descriptions: [
      "Hydrogen is a chemical element that bears the number 1 in the periodic table of elements. Its nucleus has only one proton and its main isotope is even devoid of neutrons (a unique case) which makes the atom simplest, smallest and lightest hydrogen atom",

      "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the Universe. Indeed, it represents 92% in number of atoms, 75% in mass. It is mainly present in stars and gaseous outer planets with a solid core. It is also the main component of nebulae and interstellar gas. However, it represents in the earth's crust only 0.22% of the atoms. It is therefore far behind oxygen, which represents 47% of the atoms, and silicon which represents 27% of the atoms.",

      "Hydrogen is mainly used for the production of ammonia and many other organic compounds. It was also very widely used as a gas to inflate airships. But that changed following the Hindenburg accident in 1937 since it was replaced by helium. Hydrogen is also used for the production of hydrogen bombs, also called H-bombs, in which hydrogen fuses to form helium."

On Earth, it is present combined with various elements, in the form of mineral oxides or within the chemical functions of organic compounds (alcohol, ketone, carboxylic acid, etc.). It is present in the air in the form of oxygen, in water combined with hydrogen and biological compounds. It is vital for most living organisms on earth.",

      "It composes: 86% of the mass of the oceans, in the form of water, 46.4% of the mass of the earth's crust, 23.1% of the mass of the air, in the form of dioxygen or ozone, 62.5% of the mass of the human body, up to 88% of the mass of certain marine animals.",

      "Oxygen is the source of life for the majority of living organisms on earth, however it is also responsible for our aging. Indeed, oxygen has the property of forming free radicals, very reactive elements that will disrupt biological processes."
